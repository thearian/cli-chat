## Getting Started

0. Submitting the issue (optional)

    - Feature(Adding new feature): `feat`
    - Bug Fix(including typos): `fix`
    - Cleaning(renameing vars and removing unwanted): `clean`

## Submitting Pull Request

Patchsets should always be focused.
For example, a pull request could add a feature, fix a bug, or refactor code; but not a mixture.
Please also avoid super pull requests which attempt to do too much, are overly large, or overly complex as this makes review difficult.
